# Windows Users
Run the `mimic.exe` file to start Mimic.
This is possible because of the smaller, customized JRE made by jlink, but it's only for Windows (as far as I know).

# Linux and Mac Users
1. Install Java 9.
2. Run `java -cp path_to_gui.jar gui.Main` to start Mimic, where path_to_gui.jar is the path on your machine to the jar file gui.jar (it should be in the dist folder).
